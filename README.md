# Stock-Price-Prediction
This project predicts stock prices using historical market data. It leverages machine learning models to analyze features like opening price, closing price, high, low, and trading volume. The primary objective is to build a predictive system that can assist in investment decisions and financial forecasting.
## Objectives

Clean and preprocess financial datasets

Explore historical stock trends with visualization

Train regression models (Linear Regression, LSTM, etc.)

Evaluate and compare model accuracy

Provide insights into market behavior
